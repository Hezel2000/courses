It is developed to extract information from text and comes in very handy for machine-generated files, since such files are generally standardized and keep their format.  \n","\n","In regex, patterns (consisting of a combination of regular- and metacharacters) are matched against strings. Many available token-/combinations make complex pattern often unreadable. [regex101](https://www.regex101.com) is a very useful page to dive into regular expressions and try it out interactively.\n","\n","\n","## Task\n","For this project, we want to write a regex-based file parser for XRDML files, a standardized XML-based format for XRD data. I have created a [shareable example](https://regex101.com/r/ddp03v/3) for the following exercise, in which the `sample name` is already exemplary matched.
