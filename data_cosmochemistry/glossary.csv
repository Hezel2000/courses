Or Jupiter might orbit the sun three times, while at the same time the object orbits the sun seven times (3:7 resonance). Each time the object is closest to Jupiter, Jupiter's massive gravity will slightly nudge the object out of its orbit. Over time the object's orbit is massivly differnt, much more eliptic, and might even become an Earth crossing object.

At certain distances from the Sun, an object will always at the same point on its orbit have its closest distance to Jupiter. For example, when Jupiter oribts the Sun once, an object might orbit the Sun exactly twice (1:2 resonance). Or three times (1:3 resonance). Or Jupiter might orbit the sun three times, while at the same time the object orbits the sun seven times (3:7 resonance). Each time the object is closest to Jupiter, Jupiter's massive gravity will slightly nudge the object out of its orbit.
